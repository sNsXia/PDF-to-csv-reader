# PDF-to-csv-reader
Utilised a PDF file from Fire Alarms at UC Berkeley and converted it to csv file. This project is for Daily Cal.
The initial file, upon reading through Tabula, requires manual alignment of data (Some data in the Zip Type data is wrongly placed in the previous column) and removal of the second, empty column.
The final Excel file is not completely edited and requires manual separation.
The work is done in about 3 hours by a beginner in Python and data analysis (who had to ask over 100+ questions on perplexity to deal with errors), so don't expect this to be a great work--however, it does its job quite well in converting the pdf data to excel.
Thanks Daily Californian Newsletter for the dataset and this project opportunity :).
